2019-09-14 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New [keypass2]
  Support OTP from the Tray TOTP plug-in.

- New [keypass2]

2019-09-13 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New [keypass2]
  Support OTP from the keeotp plug-in.

2019-09-12 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix [keypass2]
  The passwords history was not being imported (caused inadvertently by the change that supported
  --notimestamps).

- Fix [keypass2]
  Entries with no title would cause a warning.  These are now titled as "Untitled".

2019-07-07 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix [keychain]
  Updated documentation to refer to the new name of the Applescript conversion helper.

2019-06-24 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix [roboform]
  Handle BOM in latest v8 Windows version's export.

2019-06-21 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix [lastpass]
  Handle Lastpass' grouping (folder) hierarchy character to work with 1Password tags.

2019-06-20 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New [Utils/PIF.pm]
  Defines and handles a new type $k_totp, that will trigger generation of a TOTP type in 1Password.

- New [enpass]
  The stock login field of TOTP will be properly configured in 1Password.

- New [enpass]
  The stock login fields of Security question and answer will be placed into an Additional
  Information section, with answer being properly concealed.

- New [enpass]
  The password history is now saved for login items.

- New [lastpass]
  The converter will now split all key:value pairs inside non-Generic notes types.  This makes the
  fields available for the --addfields option.

- New [lastpass]
  The %card_field_specs table accepts 'textname' values as either strings or regular expressions.
  This allows matching multiple template names (their names are exported in the form Custom_###
  where ### is a sequence of digits).

2019-06-19 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix [enpass]
  Added more category definitions to support the JSON export type: bankacct, driverslicense, email*.
  * Support for this category is limited due to Enpass' field ambiguity and free-text field values.

2019-06-14 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix [lastpass]

  folder was on the Desktop.

2019-04-17 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New [roboform]
  Supports Roboform 8's CSV export format for Login + Bookmarks.

2019-03-28 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Change [enpass]
  Add a generic, commented-out entry to catch the 'import.imported' category.  Users can uncomment
  and customize the field matchers in this definition.  Enpass uses this category for records
  imported from another password manager; it does not convert the foreign category into its own.

2019-03-19 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Change [convert.pl]
  Change the Usage information to indicated the converter name preceed any options.  Generally the
  option positions do not matter, as convert.pl peeks on the command line to find the converter
  name.  But there is one ambiguous case where the converter is onepif and the --format selected is
  csv.

2019-03-11 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Change [macOSConvertHelper convert.pl]
  Removed hardcoded converter names from macOSConverterHelper.  These are now generated by the
  convert.pl program using the --info macos option.

- Fix [macOSConvertHelper]
  Avoid error when Terminal is already running, but no shell window is open.

2019-03-10 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2019-02-22 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Change [README vcard]
  Documentation updated with new links to conversion help threads on the 1Password forum.

2019-02-03 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix [csv]
  Document the required format of a Login's "Additional URLs" column.

2019-02-02 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New [csv]
  Login tables now support a column "Additional URLs", the value of which should be a semicolon- or
  newline-separated list of URLs.  These will be added as supplementary URLs in the Login item's
  website list (so you can click on them and have them open/fill).

- Change [GetSafari12Passwords]
  Secondary URLs are no longer placed into the Notes area; instead, they will be placed into a new
  column "Additional URLs", which is supported by the csv converter (feature is mentioned above).

2019-01-26 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix [keepass2]
  Ignore bogus date values (reported when a user imported a keepass1 db into into keepass2).

2019-01-25 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Fix [csv]
  Issue mishandling special columns that were not present in the CSV (e.g. tags, notes, created,
  modified).

2019-01-24 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Change [README.pdf]
  The README.pdf file has been replaced by a much more useful and user-friendly README.html file.
  Users can now use their favorite browser to read this guide, jump around via links, and use the
  browser's Back button to return to their previous location after a jump.  The README.html now
  walks users through the conversion process much more elegantly.

2019-01-23 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New [chrome]
  Converter option --username <str> rejects any entry in the saved passwords list if the username in
  the entry does not match the value "str".  The default is an exact string match.  To match using a
  regular expression instead, surround str with slashes, with an optional trailing i to ignore case.
  Example: --username /mrc/i will match MrC and mrc anywhere in the username component.

- Change [AppleScript_Conversion_Helper --> macOSConvertHelper]
  Renamed the AppleScript_Conversion_Helper to macOSConvertHelper.

- Change [Strawberry Perl]
  The process for Windows now recommends the installer version of Strawberry Perl instead of the
  portable version. This greatly simplifies instructions, installation, and clean-up, while reducing
  confusion.

2019-01-21 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New [csv]
  Converter now auto-detects file encodings, and supports non-comma separator characters.

- New [csv datavault]
  Convert supports cross-platform conversion (the export may be exported on one platform, but
  converted on another).

- New [lastpass]
  Accepts multiple export files, so that data and Form Fill Profiles can be converted in a single
  conversion run.

2019-01-20 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Update [Text::CSV module]
  The Text::CSV module included in lib has been updated to the latest version.  Affected modules:
  csv dataguardian datavault enpass essentialpim keeper lastpass msecure msecure5 nortonis
  onepif/csv passpack passwordsplus passwordwallet splashid truekey

- Fix [truekey]
  Don't die on the garbage dates True Key allows.

2019-01-19 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New [passwordsplus]
  Converter now works on Windows.

- Change [install_modules.bat]
  Use App::cpanminus for installing modules.  Updated script to conditionally check for and
  install modules as needed.  Rerunning the script won't try to reinstall.

- Fix [convert.pl]
  Support writing UTF-8 to the console by setting the output code page.

2019-01-17 -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Change [convert_to_1p4.pl --> convert.pl]
  The converter driver name conv_to_1p4.pl has been retired.  The new name is convert.pl.  This
  eliminates a longstanding confusion with users assuming the converter suite was useful only
  for 1Password 4.

- Change [convert_to_1p4 --> mrc-converter-suite]
  The archive sub-directory name convert_to_1p4 has been retired.  The new name differs from the
  converter driver program name to eliminate any confusion between the source directory and the
  driver program.  The zip archive unpackaged contains the single directory mrc-converter-suite.

- Change [convert.pl]
  The converter driver convert.pl no longer contains a version number; the package itself
  will be date-time versioned, and a version file will be included as Version.txt.

- Change [Changes.txt]
  The changes above required changing the format of this Changes.txt file.  See also the notes for
  Version 1.11 below.

Version 1.11:
  Changed:
  - keepass2: Changed group separator from :: to / so that it will nest as Tags using 1Password's
    tag hierarchy.
  - Removed the onepassword-utilities parent directory.  Agilebits is no longer maintaining a
    separate Git repository for utilities such as the converter suite.  As such, the directory
    is no superfluous.
  - Rework how command line options are processed to support changes below.
  - Support --debug and --verbose mode during the initialization stage of converter loading.
  - Reworked the Usage message format.  The format is no context sensitive, in that it varies
    based on whether or not a converter name has been specified, and if that converter requires
    input files.
  - AppleScript helper apps are all suffixed with .applescript now.
  - Renamed Modules directory to lib
  - txt2notes: Removed a superflous module, its functionality replaced with internal code.

  New: 
  - csv: The csv converter now supports software licenses.
  - enpass: Converter handles JSON output new in Enpass 6.
  - firefox: Initial release of Firefox native converter.
  - macOS Safari password extraction scripts Get_Safari11_Passwords and Get_Safari12_Passwords
    added to the convert_to_1p4 suite.

  Fixed:
  - keychain: Hand openssl a more restrictive key length to accommodate older installs.
  - keychain: Ignore all NULL entry
  - keychain: Fix two problems obtaining secure notes: bypass length checks for decoding
    secure notes data, and simplify RE pattern to grab the note portion in secure notes'
    XML data.
  - truekey: Converter reported -1 items as being imported when JSON export was used.
  - chrome: The base path used for the user profile on macOS was incorrect (copy/paste error)..
  - convert_to_1p4.pl was not handling the situation where multiple conversion files were
    passed on the command line and a converter supported only a single file. Converters can now
    signal that they can accept a file list.  Converters updated: roboform, txt2notes.
  - The txt2notes converter used a module that was not present on macOS (File::Type). That
    module is now included in the converter suite.

Version 1.10:
  New Converters:
  - yojimbo:	Barebone's Yojimo file export converter (converter name: yojimbo)
  - msecure5:	mSecure version 5 (converter name 'msecure5', use 'msecure' for older versions)
  - chrome:	Chrome login and credit card autofill data

  Changed:
  - onepif2html: Renamed to onepif
  - Deprecated the --nowatchtower option, and replaced it with --notimestamps.  By default, if a
    password manager supports record time stamps, they will be used to set the entry's time stamps
    within 1Password.  Use --notimestamps to allow 1Password to set the time stamps as it creates
    the records (i.e. the time you import the 1PIF file).
  - Deprecated the --modified option supported by some converters.  Time stamps on records are now
    set by default, unless the --notimestamps option is used.
  - Minor changes to several converters for consistency, to conceal certain fields such as pins,
    combination lock numbers, etc, and to properly label fields that should be password-checked
    (or not).  Converters: datavault, ewallet, handysafe, msecure, passwordsplus, roboform, safeincloud,
    safewallet, spbwallet splashid, wallet4.
  - Moved common CPAN mdules into a Modules directory for clean-up, and to facilitate building the
    zip archive.
  - Removed the directory change from the install_modules.bat file and put the instructions back into
    the README.  Too many users would miss the direcotry change when re-running the converter after
    closing the command shell.  Also added a note about changing the working drive for users who have
    their user's folder redirected to a non-C: drive.

  Fixed:
  - onepif2html: Prevent section names for empty sections from being output.
  - keychain: Skip useless keychain entries that have no attributes (or data).
  - passworddepot: Updated the date parsing to accept dot as a date separator (reported by a user).
  - Change how external shell commands are called when needed, to avoid issues when file names contain
    shell metacharacters.  The --debug option could trigger the issue, and the new Yojimbo converter
    calls out to an external command to parse an Apple binary PLIST (for webarchive files).
  - truekey: updated converter to handle the CSV output by more recent versions of True Key.
  - Updated to securely handle Perl 5.26's removal of dot from the INC path.
  - clipperz: the JSON export is now a combination of HTML+JSON - the JSON is embedded in a hidden
    textarea portion of the HTML.
  - stickypassword: Fixed some issues when using Perl 5.26 or higher.
  - datavault: Fixed a few mislabeled vehicleinfo field keys.
  - spbwallet: membership's PIN code was inadvertently going into Notes.
  - Attachments created by the converter could be corrupted on Windows.
  - onepif: This converter wasn't working for the HTML formatters when the 1PIF was generated using
    1Password 4 for Windows, whose exported 1PIF is inconsistent and non-standard.

  New: 
  - The converter suite now has the ability to safely test for insecure password using the Troy Hunt
    Pwned Passwords list.  This feature is enabled using the --checkpass option.  See the README.pdf
    for more details.  The code used to perform these checks is *not* loaded when the option is not
    supplied.
  - The keychain converter now decrypts macOS keychains.
  - AppleScript_Conversion_Helper: Many changes to simplify macOS keychain conversion.
  - AppleScript_Conversion_Helper: Will now ask for location of the convert_to_1p4 folder if it is not
    found on the Desktop.
  - onepif: Replaces the former onepif2html converter.  It now accepts the name of a "formatter"
    using the --format option.  A few formatters are available in the Formatters directory.
    The default is html_compact.  A formatter is specified using the --format option and the name of
    a formatter (its non-suffixed name, e.g. --format html_expanded).  New formatters can be added as
    required by writing the code, naming them appropriatly, and placing them into the Formatters
    directory.  Currently XLST (.xls) and Perl module (.pm) code is supported.  The name of the formatter
    specifies its output format, its descriptive meaning, and the code employed in the file.  The general
    naming scheme is <output format>_<descriptive name>.<code suffix>.  For example, html_expanded.xls will
    output "html", create an .html file, and will be processed using XML stylesheet transformations (due to
    the .xsl suffix).  Its descriptive part is simply "expanded" (one can argue that's not very descriptive).
    If there is no _<descriptive name> part in the filename, it is expected that the <output format> is
    sufficient to serve as the description as well (example: csv.pm will convert to CSV).
  - onepif: The XSTL stylesheets have been changed a bit, especially the html_expanded stylesheet (formerly
    the onepif2html2 converter).  It is now more readable with larger fonts, and places the created and
    modified dates to the top right area of the item.
  - onpif: The --outfile option is now usable so the output file and suffix can be specfied via command line.
    File suffixes will be taken from the specified formatter's name.
  - onpif: Now outputs a file name of 1P_converted.<suffix> where <suffix> reflects the chosen formatter.
    Examples: 1P_converted.html, 1P_converted.csv.
  - onpif: Now supports a --percategory option to output items into category-specific files (especially
    useful for the csv formatter).
  - roboform: Converter now supports adding custom field names and patterns to the converter to match any
    unmatched field names.  There are username and password regular expression patterns, and they are listed
    in priorty order, such that when there are multiple form strings present in the Roboform output, the
    higher priority matches are used to designate the username and password fields.
  - roboform: Converter now supports adding language-specific strings to the converter to detect the export
    type.
  - Added menu style type checking in the PIF generator for a Bank Account's (account) "type" field, and
    Identity's "sec" field.  Unsupported types go to notes.
  - csv: Added support for more categories: Bank Account, Identity, Password, and Social Security.
  - msecure: Added support for reading localization files from within the Languages directory, when they are
    not found in localation used by version 3.5.x.
  - msecure: Added new option --sepchar to allow defining the CSV separator character, useful for non-English
    locales that use comma as a digits separator.  Usage: --sepchar ";"
  - msecure: Added a check for the number of columns detected per row to help users handle issues with the
    wrong sepeator character, or when the exported CSV has been altered incorrectly.  The converter will
    abort if there are not at least 4 columns.
  - msecure: Added new option --dumpcats to dump some statistics about matched/unmatched categories in the
    export, the help in customizing the converter.  It will output the expected vs actual field counts, and
    list the titles of each entry under the number of fields found for the entry.
  - msecure: Add the mSecure Type (category) as a tag in the form of mSecure::TypeName.
  - safeincloud: Added a minimum field match threshold system to better detect categories from the ambiguous
    field names in the XML export.
  - msecure: new option --dumpcats will summarize the export's list of the categories and their field counts,
    the help in customization.
  - keeper: Converter updated to handle version Keeper Desktop 10.
  - keepass2: Fixed a problem with attachment creation (status result was being tested w/the wrong operator).
    Thanks: Ross Sechler.
  - keepass2: Fixed two typos in the attribute name LastModificationTime.  Thanks: Eamon Hetherton.
  - msecure5: New converter named msecure5 for version 5 of mSecure.  Use the older 'msecure' for versions
    prior to version 5.
  - csv: Remove a BOM if one exists.
  - Added more menu item matching in the PIF generator (categories: database, email, wireless).
  - csv: Now supports columns 'modified' and 'created', to set the record's time stamps.  These are Unix epoch
    values (seconds since 1/1/1970).
  - keeper: Converter updated to handle version Keeper Desktop 12 on Windows, which now includes a BOM.

  Internal Changes:
  - vcard: removed extraneous assigment to opts variable
  - Including the module RFT::Tokenizer with the distribution, for Yojimbo.
  - keyfinder: removed extraneous comments left over from developement

Version 1.09:
  New Converters:
  - passwordsafe:	Password Safe (pwsafe) (converter name: passwordsafe).
  - stickypassword:	Sticky Password (converter name: stickypassword).
  - wallet4:		Subsembly Wallet 4X,4W
  - truekey:		Intel True Key JSON converter (export supports logins only)
  - keyfinder:		Key Finder (Mac Product Key Finder)

  Fixed:
  - Clarify SPB Wallet export section in the README file.
  - Check for the existence of the export file before passing it onto the converter.
  - Added tag list parameter to help output for --tag option.
  - Added --tag option description to the README.
  - Handle a possible "version" line in an iCloud keychain export for keychain converter.
  - The roboform converter was not clearing the per-entry variable used to collect attibutes. Shame.
  - The onepif2html converter was outputting unnecessary web form details for Login items.
  - Avoid 'undefined' warning in safeincloud converter.
  - In keychain converter, use 'type' = "note" to indicate a secure note instead of 'desc' whose
    value string may be localized (and not 'secure note').
  - Updated the README files to reflect 1Passwords new Import dialogs.
  - Fixed some CSS and HTML errors in the onepif2html converter.
  - The new wallet4 converter was not encoding the language file correctly (as UTF8).
  - Converter keepass2 was in some cases incorrectly handling the status result of decompressing an
    attachment, and in this case, was also prematurely aborting the import conversion, causing
    the inability to create the 1PIF output file.
  - Converter keepassx didn't handle timestamps with the value "Never" when --modified was in use.
  - Converter passwordagent updated to support the new XML export format for versions above 2.6.3.
  - Added converter onepif2html2 to the AppleScript Helper temporarily.  It is a temporary converter
    producing expanded Secure Notes output, until a satisfactory output format is determined.
  - Updates to the AppleScript Conversion Helper to work correctly on OS X Sierra.  Due to sandboxing,
    the script now requires the convert_to_1p4 folder to be placed on the Desktop.  This hard-coded
    path to the converter script folder simplifies user interaction.

  New: 
  - Added some additional debug code to the keychain converter to help track down an issue.
  - Added password history support to PIF modules.
  - Added initial support for Google Apps export of Contacts (vCards).
  - The onepif2html converter will accept the 1PIF bundle directory name (and uses the file data.1pif
    contained within).
  - Converter keepass2 will store an entry's historic passwords (from the History element) into
    1Password's Previously used passwords list.
  - Converter csv now supports a CSV file containing Credit Card and Membership entries.  Currently
    the converter supports Logins, Credit Cards, and Memberships, only one category per CSV file.
  - AppleScript Conversion Helper now accepts additional command line options.

  Changed:
  - Updated two 1.08 log notes below: one spelling correction, and one correcting the location of
    function normalize_card_data().
  - Tighten username and password regular expressions in roboform converter.
  - Updated the Strawberry Perl links in the README files to the latest Perl version, and simplified the
    command line for installing the required modules.  A new batch script is used to install the modules
    and set the working directory.

  Internal Changes:
  - Added an assertion to ensure that section entries never contain null values for key attributes.
  - Removed some old, commented-out, no longer used code in the roboform converter.

Version 1.08:
  New Converters:
  - RoboForm converter now available.
  - Keeper Desktop converter now available.
  - Txt2notes converter now available, converts text files into Secure Notes.
  - F-Secure KEY converter now available.
  - Passwords Plus converter now available (OS X).

  New Features:
  - Option --addfields or -a will create custom fields for non-mappable fields instead of placing
    them into notes.
  - Option --tags or -t will add the specified comma-separated list of tags to each record.
  - The keepassx converter will decode and convert an entry's attachment. It is placed in a folder
    named 1P4_Attachments in the same location that the 1P4_import.1pif file will be created.  An entry's
    attachment is placed in a sub-directory named with the entry's Title.
  - The vcard converter option --securenote will place vCard data into a Secure Note, with custom fields
    similar to an Identity.
  - The 1PIF module supports icons if either of the Perl 'GD' or 'Image::Magick' libraries are available.
  - The vCard converter will include icons when the --icon option is specified (and the required
    library is available - see previous note).
  - Added more import types to handysafe converter; added a multiple field-matching system to assist
    category detection.
  - The handysafe converter now has support for localization (lang nl-nl).  More languages will be added
    as requested.
  - Languages directory for per-converter language translation files.
  - Added output diagnostic to onepif2html converter to indicate the name of the created output file.
  - Add support for 1Password's 'Password' category.
  - The csv converter now accepts a Tags column.  The comma-separated values within that column will be
    imported as 1Password Tags.

  Changed:
  - The --help option is a little more instructive.
  - Converter ewallet's combolock and voicemail categories go to the Password category now.
  - Converter splashid's frequentflyer now maps to the 1Password Rewards category.

  Fixed:
  - Several fixes for the onepif2html print converter: strip the BOM on Windows 1PIF exports; gracefully
    handle unknown 1PIF typeNames; support the legacy typeNames allowed in the Windows UI.
  - Minor Perl syntax changes throughout the code to satisfy Perl versions > 5.16.
  - Remove extraneous, but harmless setting of imptypes in essetialpim converter.
  - Remove extraneous comment in msecure converter; fixed duplicate key in frequentflyer definition.
  - Splashid converter was not honoring --imptypes for user-defined types (user defined types are
    specified as 'userdefined'.
  - Splashid converter was not converting \b end of line characters into newline characters in
    an entry's notes section (Windows only).
  - The debug function unfold_and_chop() was not honoring its maxlen parameter.
  - The debug function print_record was not outputing notes.
  - Date parsing was broken in some cases for converters ewallet and lastpass.
  - Several ewallet converter fixes.
  - The safewallet converter was incorrectly detecting a web login category as an irc category.
  - Several vcard converter fixes: 1) prevent vcard converter from importing an encoded photo into the notes
    section; 2) converter was bailing after the first entry in a list of vcards.  3) Uses a new module for
    parsing / packaging vCard data (Text::vFile::asData). 4) Handles vCard exports via iCloud.
  - The handysafe converter was not picking up root-level nodes.
  - Some debug output errors in Utils::PIF.pm.
  - A date converter routine for some converters could cause an error under anomalous conditions - affected
    converters: dataguardian, ironkey, keepass2, keepassx, keychain, passwordagent, passworddepot, spbwallet.
  - The datavault converter on Windows could botch some multiline entries in the notes section.
  - The onepif2html converter was not outputing a label for unlabeled URLs.
  - The onepif2html converter was not handling the Password category.
  - Converter keychain now avoids outputting a 0x0 (nil) hexvalue as a URI protocol.
  - Converter keychain export instructions for iCloud keychain export was missing part of the fully-qualified
    keychain name (e.g. local-icloud should have been local-icloud.keychain).

  Internal Changes:
  - Miscellaneous code refactoring and consolidating.
  - New module Utils::Normalize.
  - Simplify the lastpass converter's %card_field_specs table.
  - convert_to_1p4 will now accept and pass to a converter more than a single filename argument.
  - Modified the %card_field_specs table to include custom field definitions within the table.
  - Made the normalize_card_data() function universal, and moved it to Utils::Normalize.pm.
  - Code updates to work with Perl versions newer than the old requirement of Perl 5.16.
  - Debug output will include info about the export file supplied on the command line.
  - Many code cleanups.

Version 1.07:
  - New: The keepass2 converter will decode and convert an entry's attachments. They are placed in a folder
    named 1P4_Attachments in the same location that the 1P4_import.1pif file will be created.  An entry's
    attachments are placed in a sub-directory named with the entry's Title.
  - Fix: The keepass2 converter sometimes failed to parse an entry's modification time (and theoretically could
    have failed to parse other items correctly).  To resolve this, and to robustly support attachments, the parser
    was rewritten, using different XML parsing modules.
  - Fix: Essentialpim converter might have missed detection of the notes or title of a customized entry due
    to an off-by-one error iterating through a loop.
  - New: CSV converter.  This converter is just a basic CSV converter that currently only supports Logins and
    Notes.  It will be customized or updated as necessary to accommodate specific user needs.
  - Change: make UUID values all uppercase; 1Password was expecting these when using OPVault (used for creating
    band files).

Version 1.06:
  - New: LicenseKeeper converter now available.
  - New: Password Agent converter now available.

    exported data file onto the helper applet "AppleScript_Conversion_Helper", and follow the instructions.
  - Change: Updated the README to accommodate the new OS X AppleScript_Conversion_Helper.
  - Fix: Update the README to provide a workaround for problematic exports with the LastPass extension in Chrome.
  - Fix: PasswordWallet conveter now handles the reserved auto-type characters that may be present in
    username or password fields.  The tab and reverse tab characters will split the field when within
    a value, and data that follows will be placed in Notes as username- or password-specific
    field/value pairs, as in "username_part_2: next", "username_part_3: field", etc.
  - Change: Changed the stylesheet used to render the README.pdf.

    date provided by a password manager's export data.  See 'Option: --modified' in the README file.
  - Fix: An item's notes from OS X Keychain converter could contain a stringified ARRAY reference name.

  - Internal: Remove extraneous, remnant argument to UUID generation call.

Version 1.03:
  - New: EssentialPIM converter now available.

  - New: Folder creation is supported, but disabled by default.  Password managers that support folders or groups are:
    ewallet, handysafe, keepass2, keepassx, lastpass, msecure, safewallet, splashid.  Include the --folders option on
    the command line to enable folders.  Tags will still include colon-separated folder hierarchies.  See the README
    for caveats when using this option.
  - Fix: The 'location' field was not being set - it is required for 1Password for Window's extension to see the entry.
  - Fix: Typo in README file that left an extra directory level in the conversion command.
  - New: Added Secure Notes export to Keychain converter.  Also, added an entry to the table of ignored svce names.

Version 1.02:

  - New: Specifically support SplashID's 'Addressess' category (into Secure Notes).
  - Fix: Converter keepass2 was incorrectly splitting a group name that contained certain XML-reserved characters.
  - Fix: README updates: clarify LastPass export instructions; enumerate and better describe Step 4; clarify
    that attachments are not unsupported; describe a workflow for creating Folders from tagged values; remove extra
    subdirectory layer onepassword-utilities, and instruct users to place convert_to_1p4 directly onto the Desktop.
  - Change: The README file eliminates the extra folder layer onepassword-utilities and instead refers to the
    convert_to_1p4 folder.

Version 1.01:
  - Fix: More precisely construct the path to the Desktop on Windows, for the 1PIF export file, and add some debug output
    to help in any future issues.
  - New: Update SafeWallet converter to support the Windows 3.x XML version, and new categories 'irc' and 'server'.
  - Fix: SplashID converter was mishandling two or more adjacent F records.
  - Info: SplashID export encoding is suspect - added commented out decoding line in code to help users try alternate
    decoding (UTF-8 vs. macroman).
  - Change: Updated documentation to switch from ActivePerl to Strawberry Perl, since ActiveState removed 5.16 from their
    free downloads.
