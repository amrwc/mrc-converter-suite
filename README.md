## Instructions

The **mrc-converter-suite** helps convert various forms of data into a format that can be easily imported by 1Password (version 4 and above).

In most cases the process will take just a few minutes. The four basic steps for typical usage are:

[1\. Prepare Your Data](#step1)  
[2\. Convert](#step2)  
[3\. Import into 1Password](#step3)  
[4\. Cleanup](#step4)

A few specialty converters are available too, one for printing 1Password exported data or converting it to CSV, one for importing text files into 1Password, and one for importing vCard contacts.

Let's get started...

## 1\. Prepare Your Data

Jump to your password manager section below, and after your data is ready, go to the step [**2\. Convert**](#step2). Use the Table of Contents and links to quickly jump.

**Note**: This guide suggests a specific file name for your exported data file. This helps make writing these instructions easier. If you use a different name, be sure to adjust any commands that use that export file's name.

### Avast Passwords

_Converter name:_ **avastpasswords**

#### Platforms

- **macOS**: Initially tested with version 4.6.6.4372
- **Windows**: Not yet tested

#### Description

Converts your exported Avast Passwords JSON data to 1PIF for 1Password import.

#### Instructions

Launch the desktop version of Avast Passwords. You will export your Avast Passwords data as **JSON** data.

Under the `Avast Passwords > Import / Export` menu, select the `Export to JSON...` menu item. When the `Export passwords to JSON` dialog appears, navigate to your Desktop folder, and save the file with the name **pm_export.json** to your Desktop. Click `OK` when the confirmation dialog appears.

You may now quit Avast Passwords.

Next, go to step [**2\. Convert**](#step2).

---

### Bitwarden

_Converter name:_ **bitwarden**

#### Platforms

- **macOS**: Unable to test version 1.1.12 (due to a login screen bug)
- **Windows**: Initially tested with version 1.1.12

#### Description

Converts your exported Bitwarden data to 1PIF for 1Password import.

#### Instructions

Launch either the desktop version of Bitwarden, or login into your Bitwarden vault via your browser. You will export your Bitwarden data as **JSON** data.

**Exporting using the desktop app**: Use the `File > Export Vault` menu. When the `EXPORT VAULT` dialog appears, set the `File Format` to `.json`. Provide your master password, and click the download button icon (at the bottom left of the dialog). In the `Save As` dialog, navigate to your **Desktop** folder, and save the file with the name **pm_export** to your Desktop.

**Exporting using the browser**: Log into your Bitwarden vault using your browser. Click on the `Tools` item at the top of the page. Click on the `Export Vault` item in the left side bar under the `Tools` section. Set the `File Format` to `.json`. Provide your master password, and click the `Export Vault` button. When the browser's dialog appears, save the export - it will be saved to your browser's downloads area. Find the exported JSON file in your browser's downloads area. The downloaded file will be named something like _bitwarden_export_20190309125037_. Move this file to your Desktop. That will be the file name you supply to the converter (you may rename it).

You may now quit Bitwarden.

#### Notes

Attachments are not exported by Bitwarden.. Be sure to download any attachments you have saved in your Bitwarden vault.

Next, go to step [**2\. Convert**](#step2).

### Chrome

_Converter name:_ **chrome**

#### Platforms

- **macOS**: 65.0.3325.146 tested, earlier versions probably work
- **Windows**: 65.0.3325.146 tested, earlier versions probably work

#### Description

This converter decrypts and converts your Chrome Logins and Credit Card profile data.

#### Instructions

You do not need to supply a file name on the command line.

On **macOS**, the converter will cause two password dialogs to be presented, requesting access to your macOS Login keychain and the Chrome-specific password record that protects your Chrome storage (this key is required to decrypt your encrypted Chrome autofill entries). Supply the passwords when requested.

After exporting your data, you must quit Chrome before running the converter.

#### Options

The `--username` option allows you to reject any entry in the saved passwords list if the username does not match the specified <string> argument. THe _<string>_ argument can be string or a regular expression pattern. The default is an exact string match. To match using a regular expression, surround _<string>_ with forward-slashes, with an optional trailing **i** to ignore case.

Example: `--username /mrc/i` will match **MrC** and **mrc** anywhere in the username component.

Next, go to step [**2\. Convert**](#step2).

---

### Clipperz

_Converter name:_ **clipperz**

#### Platforms

- **macOS**: Clipperz is a web program, and has no version numbers; initially tested on Sept 2014
- **Windows**: Clipperz is a web program, and has no version numbers; initially tested on Sept 2014

#### Description

Converts your exported Clipperz data to 1PIF for 1Password import.

#### Instructions

Log into [Clipperz](https://clipperz.is/app/) to export your database.

When logged in, select the menu button in the upper right of the interface (the 3 stacked bars). Select `Data`, then select `Export`, and then click the `download HTML+JSON` button on the left.

Some browsers such as Firefox or Internet Explorer may ask what to do with the file. You want to **Save** the file - in Firefox, for example, click the `Save File` selector and then click `OK`. Other browsers may immediately save the file to your browser's Downloads folder.

The downloaded file will be named something like _20190115-Clipperz_Export.html_. Move this file to your Desktop. That will be the file name you supply to the converter (you may rename it).

You may now logoff the Clipperz site.

#### Notes

The Clipperz converter supports only English field names.

Next, go to step [**2\. Convert**](#step2).

---

### CSV

_Converter name:_ **csv**

#### Platforms

- **macOS**: Supported
- **Windows**: Supported

#### Description

The **csv** converter is a generic CSV/TSV (comma or tab separated values) converter that supports conversion to from CSV/TSV to 1PIF, for the following 1Password categories:

- Bank Account
- Credit Card
- Identity
- Login
- Membership
- Password
- Social Security
- Software License

The converter defaults to CSV. If your file is in a TSV (or other separated-values) format, you can specify the separator character on the command line using the `--sepchar` option with a _char_ argument. The _char_ argument can be `\t` or the case-insensitive word **tab** (e.g. `--sepchar tab`). Other characters are supported, but not double-quotes.

#### Instructions

Format your file such that it contains only a single category of data per file. The category types are listed above.

Construct the file using a _spreadsheet_ program. It is not a good idea to use a text editor to manually construct a CSV/TSV file, unless you clearly understand CSV/TSV formatting and quoting rules, and file encodings.

The first row of the data _must_ be the header row, and it _must_ contain specifically named field labels. These are used to inform the converter about the data contained in the column, and to identify the target 1Password category. The names for the field label are indicated in the table below. Those shown in **bold** trigger category detection - you need at least one of these. Additional per-category notes and requirements are listed in the table.

- Labels are case-insensitive.
- The order of the columns in your file is irrelevant.
- You may supply additional columns with your own custom labels.
- You **must** include at least one of the field labels shown in bold in the table below.
- The converter will detect the file's encoding, when it contains a BOM (byte order mark). Valid encodings are: UTF-8, UTF-16BE, UTF-16LE, UTF-32BE, and UTF-32LE. If there is no BOM, UTF-8 or ASCII is assumed.

**Note 7**: Additional URLs is a semcolon- or newline-separated list of URLs - these will be added as supplementary (i.e. clickable, open and fill) URLs in the Login item.</td>

</tr>

</tbody>

</table>

#### Additional Columns

There are a few additional reserved field label names: **Tags**, **Modified**, and **Created**. These will be treated specially.

Data in the **Tags** column will be used to set the 1Password item's **Tag** value. Multiple tags may be assigned using a comma-separated list of values.

The columns **Modified** and/or **Created** will be used to set the item's modified and created dates, respectively. The values are Unix epoch integers (seconds since 1/1/1970). Invalid values will cause the data to be stored in the item's Notes area.

You may have additional columns. The labels you've supplied will be used to create custom fields in the 1Password item. Do not use any of the reserved field labels mentioned elsewhere.

This converter supports cross-platform conversion (the export may be exported on one platform, but converted on another).

Next, go to step [**2\. Convert**](#step2).

### Data Guardian

_Converter name:_ **dataguardian**

#### Platforms

- **macOS**: Initially tested with version 3.2
- **Windows**: Initially tested with version 3.2

#### Description

Converts your exported Data Guardian data to 1PIF for 1Password import.

#### Instructions

Launch Data Guardian.

Export its database to a CSV text file using the `Record > Export...` menu item. From the left side bar, select **Text**. Under the list of fields that can be exported, click the `Check All` button. In the `Field Delimiter` pulldown, select the `Comma (CSV)` choice. Under `Options`, select the `Include header row` checkbox. Click the `Export` button, and when the `Export Database` dialog appears, navigate to your Desktop folder. Save the file to your **Desktop** folder with a simple name such as **pm_export.txt**. When the dialog appears asking which suffix to use, select the `use .txt` button.

You may now quit Data Guardian.

#### Notes

Data Guardian does not construct a reliable CSV file. In certain cases, it is impossible to determine one field from the next field (the field's value will contain one or more (unescaped) commas and/or double quotes). When this occurs, the converter will skip the record, and report an error indicating the name of the record.

This converter supports cross-platform conversion (the export may be exported on one platform, but converted on another).

Next, go to step [**2\. Convert**](#step2).

---

### DataVault

_Converter name:_ **datavault**

#### Platforms

- **macOS**: Initially tested with version 5.2.39
- **Windows**: Initially tested with version 5.1.32

#### Description

Converts your exported DataVault data to 1PIF for 1Password import.

#### Instructions

Launch DataVault.

Export its database to a text file using the `Tools > Export` menu item. Select the `All Items (DVX, CSV)` choice, and click `OK`. In the `Save As` dialog, navigate to your **Desktop** folder, set the file to **pm_export.csv**, and leave the `Save as type` set to `CSV files (.csv files)`. Save the export.

You may now quit DataVault.

#### Notes

The DataVault CSV export is generally lossy. It does not export the Category, Type, or Template information.

The DataVault CSV export on Windows is lossy. The user interface accepts Unicode characters, however, only latin1 characters are exported to the CSV file. Non-latin1 characters are transliterated. For example, the character **ş** becomes **s**.

The CSV export for DataVault for macOS does not properly CSV-quote its data. This will cause the converter to skip the problematic record and generate a warning. You will need to manually enter any of these noted records.

DataVault has several essentially identical templates that are indistinguishable in the CSV export. These are treated as identical converter input types, and are listed below:

- bank account, checking account --> bankacct
- business contact, personal contact --> contact
- credit card, mastercard, visa --> creditcard
- business, financial --> business

Next, go to step [**2\. Convert**](#step2).

### Enpass

_Converter name:_ **enpass**

#### Platforms

- **macOS**: Initially tested with version 5.6.3; version 6 beta in progress
- **Windows**: Initially tested with version 5.6.3; version 6 beta in progress

#### Description

Converts your exported Enpass data to 1PIF for 1Password import.

#### Instructions

Launch Enpass and set the language to English under `Tools > Settings > Advanced > Language`. Quit Enpass completely and relaunch it. The language must be set to English so that field names in the export file can match those expected by the converter.

**Enpass version 6**: Export your data as **JSON**. Use the `File > Export` menu, select the vault from the `Select Vault You Want to Export` pulldown, and select the `.json` format. Select your **Desktop** folder under the `Choose Location` selector, enter the file name **pm_export**, and click `Save`. Now click the `Export` button, provide your master password when the Export dialog appears, and click the `Continue` button. Next click the `Done` button. There will now be a file on your Desktop named **pm_export.json** - use this file name on the command line.

**Enpass versions prior to 6**: Export your Enpass data as **CSV**. Use the `File > Export > as CSV` menu. Provide your master password when the Export dialog appears, and click the `OK` button. Next click the `OK` button in the dialog that warns you about the data export being unprotected. In the `Save` dialog, navigate to your **Desktop** folder, and save the file with the name **pm_export.txt** to your Desktop.

You may now quit Enpass.

#### Notes

Enpass' CSV exports are problematic and ambiguous. The converter attempts to handle these situations, but some data can cause issues. In such cases, you may need to open your export file in a spreadsheet and correct any entries that have been split into two rows , and re-export to CSV in UTF-8 format.

There are several generic _Other_ categories in Enpass, and these contain only two stock fields "Field 1" and "Field 2". Because these records are indistinguishable in the export, the converter maps them to a single **other** category.

Most of Enpass' field values are free-form text (they are not validated, and may be nonsensical). Given this, the converter will not attempt to place some values into a specific 1Password field, but instead must place these values into the Notes area as label / value pairs.

Records imported into Enpass 6 from another password manager are not converted to Enpass' own internal categories. They are instead placed into a generic category. The converter cannot automatically determine the record type for these records, because the field names and semantics vary based on the original password manager. The result will be that many of your records will convert as Secure Notes. The converter can be customized to handle your data. If you are in this situation, use the `--dumpcats` option to examine the field names present in the "import.imported" category shown in the output. You can decide which of these fields should be mapped to the username, password, and URL fields for a Login category. There is a commented-out entry in the Enpass.pm converter file's table of category/field names which can be uncommented and tailored to your data. Ask if you need help.

Next, go to step [**2\. Convert**](#step2).

### EssentialPIM

_Converter name:_ **essentialpim**

#### Platforms

- **macOS**: N/A
- **Windows**: Initially tested with version 6.04

#### Description

Converts your exported EssentialPIM data to 1PIF for 1Password import.

#### Instructions

Launch EssentialPIM and export its password database to a text file using the `File > Export > Password Entries > Comma Separated Values (*.csv)...` menu. Select All entries from the `Entries to be exported` dialog. Optionally, you may select the fields you want exported by selecting the `Fields...` button (however, you should keep selected the fields that correspond to the stock fields: **Title**, **User Name**, **Password**, **URL**, and **Notes**). Click the `OK` button, and navigate to your **Desktop** folder, and save the file with the name **pm_export.txt**.

You may now quit EssentialPIM.

#### Notes

EssentialPIM does _not_ properly handle the exported field names when the names contain any comma characters. Before you export, edit a single password entry record in EssentialPIM, and examine each of your field names. Replace all commas in the field names with some other character. Editing the field names inside a single record will globally change the field names for all records. Once the commas are removed from the field names, you may export your data safely.

Next, go to step [**2\. Convert**](#step2).

### eWallet

_Converter name:_ **ewallet**

#### Platforms

- **macOS**: Initially tested using 7.3
- **Windows**: Initially tested using 7.6.4

#### Description

Converts your exported eWallet data to 1PIF for 1Password import.

#### Instructions

Launch eWallet.

Export its database to a text file using the `File > Save As > Text File...` menu. Save the file with the name **pm_export.txt** to your Desktop.

You may now quit eWallet.

#### Notes

The eWallet type of Picture Card will be exported as Secure Notes; no pictures will be exported.

eWallet's export format is ambiguous and not well-defined. The converter attempts to determine proper record boundaries, but can fail if a card's notes contain a certain pattern. The pattern is a blank line followed by the word <bcard>followed by a space and then anything else. For example, notes containing the following text would confound the converter's ability to detect the card's boundaries:</bcard>

    My poker notes.

    Card players rule.

    Final hand - the pattern "Card " above will cause a flop.

If the number of records output stated by the converter is the same as the number you have in eWallet, this problem did not occur. If you have extra records, the problem may have occurred, and you should examine the data imported into 1Password. To remedy the problem, be sure no notes in eWallet contain the pattern {blank line}Card{space}{anything else} - it is sufficient to simply lowercase the word **Card**, or add some other character in front of the **C**, such as **x**Card.

Next, go to step [**2\. Convert**](#step2).

### Firefox

_Converter name:_ **firefox**

#### Platforms

- **macOS**: Initially tested with version 64
- **Windows**: Initially tested with version 64

#### Description

Converts your Firefox Logins & Passwords data to 1PIF for 1Password import.

#### Instructions

Quit Firefox before running the converter.

This converter does not require an export file; you do not need to supply one on the command line. The converter finds your Firefox profile data and directly decrypts the found data files. For each profile, it will ask if you want the profile converted, and if so, it will ask for the master password for that profile. Enter the profile's master password when requested.

Next, go to step [**2\. Convert**](#step2).

### KeePass 2

_Converter name:_ **keepass2**

#### Platforms

- **macOS**: Untested (a version 2 XML export should work)
- **Windows**: Initially tested with version 2.26

#### Description

Converts your exported KeePass 2 data to 1PIF for 1Password import.

#### Instructions

Launch KeePass 2.

Export its database to an XML export file using the `File > Export ...` menu item, and select the `KeePass XML (2.x)` format. In the `File: Export to:` section at the bottom of the dialog, click the floppy disk icon to select the location. Select your **Desktop** folder, and in the `File name` area, enter the name **pm_export.txt**. Click `Save`. You should now have the file named **pm_export.xml** on your Desktop - use this file name on the command line.

You may now quit KeePass 2.

#### Notes

The converter will decode and convert any attachments contained in an item. They are placed in a folder named **1P_Attachments** at the same location that the **1P_import.1pif** file is created (your Desktop, by default). The attachments are placed in a sub-directory with the same name as the item (its Title).

This converter supports cross-platform conversion (the export may be exported on one platform, but converted on another).

This converter imports the OTP key used by the keeotp plug-in, such that your OTPs will work in 1Password.

Next, go to step [**2\. Convert**](#step2).

---

### KeePassX

_Converter name:_ **keepassx**

#### Platforms

- **macOS**: Initially tested with version .0.4.3 - See Notes below
- **Windows**: N/A

#### Description

Converts your exported KeePassX data to 1PIF for 1Password import.

#### Instructions

Launch KeePassX.

Export its database to a text file using the `File > Export to > KeePassX XML File...` menu. Navigate to your **Desktop** folder, and save the file with the name **pm_export.txt** to your Desktop.

You may now quit KeePassX.

#### Notes

KeePassX version 2.0 does _not_ support exporting to XML. However, its database can be read by KeePass 2. If you can install KeePass 2, you can use the KeePass 2 instructions above to perform the export and conversion using the **keepass2** converter. Unfortunately KeePass 2 installation on an macOS system is non-trivial, so if you have a PC, do the export there. You can convert the XML on either platform. KeePassX version 2 can export to CSV, so an alternative is to export in that format, and use the **csv** converter to perform the conversion.

The converter will decode and convert any attachments contained in an item. They are placed in a folder named **1P_Attachments** at the same location that the **1P_import.1pif** file is created (your Desktop, by default). The attachments are placed in a sub-directory with the same name as the item (its Title).

Next, go to step [**2\. Convert**](#step2).

#### Instructions

Launch Keeper Desktop.

Export its database to a file using the `Backup` button on the upper right side of the window.

**Keeper 10**: Press the last `Export Now` button, labeled `Export to Text File`. Keeper will open a Finder folder for you, with the exported file (it is named to include the export date, such as _20170815210313-keeper.txt_). Drag the file to your **Desktop** folder. You may rename it to **pm_export.txt** to simplify the name you supply on the command line.

**Versions prior to Keeper 10**: Press the last `Export Now` button, labeled `Export to Excel (not encrypted)`. Navigate to your **Desktop** folder, and save the file with the name **pm_export.txt** to your Desktop.

You may now quit Keeper Desktop.

#### Notes

This converter supports cross-platform conversion (the export may be exported on one platform, but converted on another).

Next, go to step [**2\. Convert**](#step2).

### Keychain

_Converter name:_ **keychain**

#### Platforms

- **macOS**: Tested on macOS 10.9.5 to 10.14
- **Windows**: N/A

#### Description

Converts your macOS local keychain data to 1PIF for 1Password import.

#### Instructions

Launch Keychain.

This converter can convert local macOS keychains. It cannot directly convert iCloud keychains (see Notes below for limitations). There is no need to export any data for this converter. It will read and decrypt the keychain data directly from the specified keychain file. The simplest method to convert a keychain is to use the **macOSConvertHelper**. Otherwise, you will need to supply on the command line the _full_ path to the keychain file you wish to export (see Notes below). In either case, the converter will request the password for the specified keychain. Provide it when asked, and hit Enter.

#### Notes

To get a list your keychain paths, in the Terminal app, use the command:

    security list-keychains

A list will be output and you can just copy the entire line for the desired keychain, and paste it on the command line.

Conversion of an iCloud keychain requires copying entries to a new _local_ keychain (there is no direct access to it). This, however, has become problematic in macOS Sierra and above. Some entries will not copy, and you will receive non-specific error messages. If you want to get your Safari passwords, use the appropriate **Get_Safari**_##_**\_Passwords** AppleScript supplied with the converter suite package instead.

To export an iCloud Keychain, you need to create a new local keychain and copy the contents from the iCloud Keychain. Launch the **Keychain Access** app, and select the `File > New Keychain` menu item. Name the keychain **local-icloud**, and click the `Create` button. Enter a password and click `OK`. Under the `Keychains` section, select the `iCloud` keychain. Now select all of the items in that keychain on the right, and copy them with `Edit > Copy` (or ⌘ + C). Select the **local-icloud** keychain, and paste the entries with `Edit > Paste` (or ⌘ + V) . If macOS allows the paste (it may fail), you will be presented with _many_ authorization dialogs. Enter your password repeatedly, as requested. To simply entering your password, open a new script document in **Script Editor**, and copy/paste the following script:

        set keychainPassword to "MYPASSWORD"

        tell application "System Events"
                repeat while exists (processes where name is "SecurityAgent")
                        tell process "SecurityAgent"
                                set frontmost to true
                                if (count of windows) > 0 then
                                        set window_name to name of front window
                                end if
                                try
                                        # keystroke "password"
                                        keystroke keychainPassword
                                        delay 0.1
                                        keystroke return
                                        delay 0.1
                                on error
                                        -- do nothing to skip the error
                                end try
                        end tell
                        delay 0.4
                end repeat
        end tell

replacing the word **MYPASSWORD** with the password you just set for the keychain. Run the AppleScript to automate performing the password entry.

You may then use the **macOSConvertHelper/** and select the **local-icloud** keychain you just created.

Once the export and conversion has completed, you may delete the **local-icloud** keychain in `Keychain Access` (delete both References and Files).

You may now quit **Keychain Access** and **Script Editor**.

Copying items from an **iCloud Keychain** to a local keychain sets the modified and created dates of the pasted entries to the time of the paste. The original dates are not retained in the copies.

Some items from the iCloud keychain cannot be copied. You may have to work in batches to determine which can be copied and which cannot. Resolving the reason for these failures is beyond the scope of this document.

Next, go to step [**2\. Convert**](#step2).

### Key Finder

_Converter name:_ **keyfinder**

#### Platforms

- **macOS**: Initially tested with version 1.2.0.32
- **Windows**: N/A

#### Description

Converts your exported Key Finder data to 1PIF for 1Password import.

#### Instructions

Launch Key Finder.

Export its database as an XML export file using the `File > Save > Save to XML (*.xml)` menu item. When the `Save` dialog appears, enter the name **pm_export.xml**. Next, expand the dialog by pressing the downward triangle at the right of the `Save As` field, select **Desktop** from the sidebar, and finally, press the `Save` button.

You may now quit Key Finder.

Next, go to step [**2\. Convert**](#step2).

### LastPass

_Converter name:_ **lastpass**

#### Platforms

- **macOS**: Tested with various browser extension versions
- **Windows**: Tested with various browser extension versions (initially 3.1.54 Firefox/Windows)

#### Description

Converts your exported LastPass data and Form Fill Profiles.

#### Instructions

Launch the browser you normally use with LastPass (but first see **Notes** below).

LastPass will either export your data directly to a file, or it may open a browser window with the exported data in that window. More recent version of LastPass tend to do the latter.

If you have the LastPass browser extension installed, from the extension, and depending on your version of the extension, select either `More Options > Advanced > Export > LastPass CSV File` or `Tools > Advanced Tools > Export To > LastPass CSV File` and when prompted, enter your LastPass vault password. If the exported data opens in a browser window, follow the instructions below. If LastPass opens a `Save` dialog, navigate to your **Desktop**>\* folder in the `Select a file to export to` dialog, and in the `File name` area, enter the name **pm_export.txt**, and click `Save`.

If your LastPass exported data appeared in a separate browser window, you need to select all of the data on the page, copy it, and save it to a plain text file.

On macOS, select all of the data on the export page (⌘ + A) and Copy it (⌘ + C). Launch TextEdit, and go to the menu `TextEdit > Preferences`. In the `New Document` tab, under `Format`, select `Plain Text` and close that dialog. Open a new document (⌘ + N), and paste the data you copied earlier (⌘ + V). Save the file to the Desktop with the file name **pm_export.txt**, selecting `Unicode (UTF-8)` as the `Plain Text Encoding`.

On Windows, select all of the data on the export page (Ctrl + A) and Copy it (Ctrl + C). Launch Notepad, and paste the data your copied earlier (⌘ + V). Save the data using `File > Save As...` and save the file to the Desktop with the file name **pm_export**. By default, Windows will add the `.txt` suffix.

You may now close the LastPass browser window.

#### Notes

The LastPass extension for Chrome incorrectly opens the export as an HTML document. If you are using Chrome as your browser, do not use the extension to start the export. Instead, either use the LastPass extension in a different browser, or use the `Tools > Advanced > Export` item in the left sidebar when your vault is open in the browser (you will have to use the copy / paste method mentioned in the note above).

LastPass exports _Form Fill Profiles_ separately, using the `Tools > Advanced Tools > Export To > Form Fill Profiles` menu. If you wish to convert and import your Form Fill Profiles, export these to a separate export file, perhaps naming it **pm_export_ff.txt**.

#### Notes

You may specify more than one LastPass export file on the command line. The converted data will be output into a single 1PIF file for import. This allows you to convert both of your LastPass data and Form Fill Profiles into a single conversion.

This converter supports cross-platform conversion (the export may be exported on one platform, but converted on another).

Next, go to step [**2\. Convert**](#step2).

### LicenseKeeper

_Converter name:_ **licensekeeper**

#### Platforms

- **macOS**: Initially tested with version 1.8.4 (1702)
- **Windows**: N/A

#### Description

Converts your exported LicenseKeeper data to 1PIF for 1Password import.

#### Instructions

Launch LicenseKeeper.

Export its database as an XML export file using the `File > Export > Library to XML...` menu item. When the folder save dialog appears, select **Desktop** from the sidebar, and then click the `Choose Export Folder` button. This will store the XML file inside a folder named **LicenseKeeper Export**. The file named **LicenseKeeper.xml** inside that folder is your exported XML data.

You may now quit LicenseKeeper.

#### Notes

The converter will rename the exported, name-encoded attachments. They will be prefixed by the item's Title, and can be found in the **Attachments** folder within the **LicenseKeeper Export** folder.

Next, go to step [**2\. Convert**](#step2).

---

### mSecure 3

_Converter name:_ **msecure**

#### Platforms

- **macOS**: Initially tested with version 3.54 (see Notes)
- **Windows**: Initially tested with version 3.54 (see Notes)

#### Description

Converts your exported mSecure 3 data to 1PIF for 1Password import. If you need to convert from mSecure version 5, use the **msecure5** converter.

#### Instructions

Launch mSecure 3.

Export its database as a CSV export file using the `File > Export > CSV File...` menu item. Click `OK` to the warning dialog that advises caution since your data will be exported in an unencrypted format. Navigate to your **Desktop** folder in the `Export File` dialog, and in the `File name` area, enter the name **pm_export.txt**. Click `Save`.

You may now quit mSecure.

#### Notes

**macOS**: Versions of mSecure earlier than 3.5.4 do not produce properly formatted CSV. The converter attempts to compensate for this, but may fail.

**Windows** mSecure version 3.5.4 (and probably earlier) do not produce properly formatted CSV. There are issues with the characters backslash \ and double-quotes ". There may be additional issues due to the incorrect and ambiguous handling of these escape and quoting characters. The converter attempts to compensate for this, but may fail. Before you uninstall mSecure, you should verify your data against the data imported into 1Password.

**Windows** The mSecure CSV export on Windows is lossy. The user interface accepts Unicode characters, however, only latin1 characters are exported to the CSV file. Non-latin1 characters are transliterated. For example, the character **ş** becomes **s**.

mSecure does not output field labels. Before you uninstall mSecure, you should verify that you understand the _meaning_ of the fields after you import into 1Password. Take a screenshot or write down your mSecure field names, and order of your customized fields and cards, and compare these against the data imported into 1Password.

Next, go to step [**2\. Convert**](#step2).

---

### mSecure 5

_Converter name:_ **msecure5**

#### Platforms

- **macOS**: 5.x (see Notes)
- **Windows**: Untested

#### Description

Converts your exported mSecure 5 data to 1PIF for 1Password import. If you need to convert from mSecure prior to version 5, use the **msecure** converter.

#### Instructions

Launch mSecure 5.

Launch mSecure, and export its database as a CSV export file using the `File > Export > CSV File...` menu item. Click `OK` to the warning dialog that advises caution since your data will be exported in an unencrypted format. Navigate to your **Desktop** folder in the `Export File` dialog, and in the `File name` area, enter the name **pm_export.txt**. Click `Save`.

You may now quit mSecure.

#### Notes

The mSecure export format and features of mSecure 5 have changed dramatically from previous versions. mSecure 5 eliminated older, infrequently used Types, and changed the names of some common Types. It is not yet clear how user data imported into mSecure 5 from older mSecure vaults is handled. Your feedback is appreciated.

mSecure does not output field labels. Before you uninstall mSecure, you should verify that you understand the _meaning_ of the fields after you import into 1Password. Take a screenshot or write down your mSecure field names, and order of your customized fields and cards, and compare these against the data imported into 1Password.

The mSecure 5 CSV export sidesteps correctly encoding its CSV export. It converts double-quotes into Unicode left **“** and right **”** quotes (Unicode 0x201c and 0x201d, respectively) for some fields. This converter must reconvert these back to double-quotes and this, however, leaves the possibility that intentional left and right Unicode quotes may get converted to ASCII double-quotes.

Next, go to step [**2\. Convert**](#step2).

### Norton Identity Safe

_Converter name:_ **nortonis**

#### Platforms

- **macOS**: Untested (see Notes)
- **Windows**: Initially tested with version 2014.7.11.42

#### Description

You may now quit Norton Identity Safe.

#### Notes

**macOS**: Norton Identity Safe exports on macOS have not been untested - a trial version of the software was unavailable. It should work, but please report your results.

Norton Identity Safe does not export the Wallet items Credit Card, Bank Account, or Identity. It only exports Login and Note items.

Norton Identity Safe does not export Tags.

This converter supports cross-platform conversion (the export may be exported on one platform, but converted on another).

Next, go to step [**2\. Convert**](#step2).

### 1Password 1PIF (to HTML, CSV)

_Converter name:_ **onepif**

#### Platforms

- **macOS**: 1Password 4 or higher
- **Windows**: 1Password 4 or higher

#### Description

This is a simple 1Password 1PIF converter that converts exported 1Password 1PIF data into CSV suitable for opening in a spreadsheet, or into various HTML formats suitable for printing. It uses one of the several _formatters_ to drive the conversion. These drivers can be written as XML / XSLT, or Perl modules, but other transformers are possible. The format drivers are in the **Formatters** folder.

#### Instructions

Launch 1Password. Export the desired data to a 1PIF export file using the `File > Export > All Items...` menu item (or chose the `Selected Items` sub-menu to export only the selected items). Enter your Master Password when requested, and click `OK`. Navigate to your **Desktop** folder in the `Export` dialog, and in the `File name` area, enter the name **UNENCRYPTED_DATA**. Set the File Format to `1Password Interchange Format (.1pif)` if it is not already selected. Click `Save`. There should now be a 1PIF file with the name above on your Desktop.

You may now quit 1Password.

#### Notes

After export, 1Password for Mac places the actual 1PIF file inside a folder with the file name you entered above in the `File name` area. 1Password will open this folder after the export completes. Inside will be a file named **data.1pif**. This is the data file the converter will work on. You can supply either that file's path, or the folder's, to the converter.

The output formatting is controlled by the formatter specified using the `--format` option. Provide a formatter name (the name of a file in the **Formatters** folder, without the file suffix). Example: `--format html_expanded`.

Next, go to step [**2\. Convert**](#step2).

**Windows**: On the left side, select your password file's name (or the highest level folder you want to export). Select the `Tools` ribbon menu item, click the `Export` button, and select the `Export Wizard` item. Enter your Password Depot password when the dialog appears, and press `OK`. The `Export format` should be left as `Extensible Markup Language format (*.xml)`. Click the `Browse` button, navigate to your **Desktop** folder and in the `File name` area, enter the name **pm_export.xml**. Be sure the `Original folder` pulldown has the top-level folder you want exported (the top level is the entire contents of the password file). Click `Next` to complete the export and then click `Finish` to close out the wizard. Your XML text export file with the name you provided above is now on your Desktop.

You may now quit Password Depot.

#### Notes

Password Depot supports formatted text in Information items on Windows. It does not, however, export this formatting information - only the raw text is exported.

Password Depot does not export your attachments. Be sure to save them from within Password Depot before you remove it from your system.

Next, go to step [**2\. Convert**](#step2).

### RoboForm

_Converter name:_ **roboform**

#### Platforms

- **macOS**: Initially tested with version 1.95
- **Windows**: Initially tested with version 6.9.99 (see Notes)

#### Description

Converts your RoboForm Passcards/Logins, Identities, and Safenotes data to 1PIF for 1Password import.

#### Instructions

Launch RoboForm (macOS) or the Roboform Editor (Windows).

Roboform requires three separate exports, one export for each of Logins + Bookmarks + Passcards, Identities, and Safenotes. This converter can convert all of these exports at the same time. Roboform version 8 on Windows and macOS supports exporting your Logins + Bookmarks to a CSV format. Version 8.5.9 added Safenote export via CSV. As this is a more robust export format, use it to export this data. Identities and Safenotes (prior to 8.5.9) can only be exported via Roboform's Print List function.

Export your Roboform data according to your platform and Roboform version as follows:

**Widows RoboForm 8**: To export your Logins + Bookmarks, click the `RoboForm` pulldown menu at the top left of the editor, and select `Options...`. Select `Account & Data`, and press the `Export` button. Select the highest level of data you wish to export, and set the `Format` to `CSV file`. Click the `Browse` button, and navigate to your **Desktop**. Set the file name to be **pm_export_logins.csv**, and click the `Save` button. Roboform 8.5.9 allows you to select the items to export (Logins, Bookmarks, Safenotes) - select the data types you want exported. Click the `Export` button now, and click the `Yes` button to acknowledge the confirmation dialog. After the export has completed, click the export dialog's `Close` button.

To export your Identities or Safenotes (prior to version 8.5.9), click the `RoboForm` pulldown menu at the top left of the editor, and select `Print List > Identities` or `Print List > Safenotes` Enter your master password when prompted. When the print dialog appears, click the `Save` button. Navigate to your **Desktop** folder, and save the file with either the name **pm_export_identities.html** or **pm_export_safenotes.html**, depending upon which type of data you exported. Save this export file to your Desktop. You can do likewise for the other export type if you wish.

**Windows RoboForm 7**: Click the green `RoboForm` button in the upper left of the dialog, and select `Print List... > Logins`. Enter your master password when prompted. When the print dialog appears, click the `Save` button. Navigate to your **Desktop** folder, and save the file with the name **pm_export_logins.html** to your Desktop.

You may export your Identities and Safenotes now, using the same procedure, but using a different file name such as **pm_export_identities.html** and **pm_export_safenotes.html**, respectively.

**Windows RoboForm 6**: Use the Passcard Editor's `Passcard > Print List...` menu item. When the `Roboform Passcards List` dialog appears, select `Passcards` from the pulldown at the top of the dialog, and enable the `Full URL` checkbox. Click the `Save` button. Navigate to your **Desktop** folder, and save the file with the name **pm_export_logins.html** to your Desktop.

You may export your Identities and Safenotes now, using the same procedure, but using a different file name such as **pm_export_identities.html** and **pm_export_safenotes.html**, respectively.

**macoS Roboform 8**: Use the `File > Export` menu. Set the `Format` at the bottom of the dialog to `CSV file`. Select the highest level of data you wish to export, and set the `Format` to `CSV file`. Click the `Browse` button, and navigate to your **Desktop**. Set the file name to be **pm_export_logins.csv**, and click the `Select folder for export` button. Click the `Export` button now, and click the `Yes` button to acknowledge the confirmation dialog. After the export has completed, click the export dialog's `Close` button.

To export your Identities and Safenotes, follow the basic procedure below for versions prior to 8.

**macOS Roboform < version 8**: Use the `File > Print List...` menu and select `Logins`. RoboForm will save a file to your Desktop that begins with the name **RoboForm Logins** and ends with today's date. This is your conversion file - you may rename it to a simpler **pm_export_logins.html**.

You may export your Identities and Safenotes now, using the same procedure, but using a different file name such as **pm_export_identities.html** and **pm_export_safenotes.html**, respectively.

You may now quit RoboForm.

#### Notes

This converter can convert one or more export files at once, so you may specify each of the files you exported above on the same command line. Example:

    perl convert.pl roboform -v pm_export_logins.html pm_export_identities.html pm_export_safenotes.html

The command above will convert all three export files into a single 1PIF file containing your converted Passcards/Logins, Identity items, and Safenotes.

RoboForm version 7 does not export the full original URL for Login items. You will probably need to edit some login entries within 1Password to make Open and Fill work correctly.

When using the Print List export format for Logins, the username and password values depend on the original names used on the web page's form data. Roboform exports these labels, and the converter uses prioritized pattern matching to determine which of these fields maps to the username and the password. The patterns may need adjustment to better match your data. It is beyond the scope of these instructions to describe the process. See the comments in the Roboform.pm converter module, or ask for help.

Roboform does not export the "Login Tip" in a CSV export.

Next, go to step [**2\. Convert**](#step2).

### vCard (from Contacts)

_Converter name:_ **vcard**

#### Platforms

- **macOS**: Initially tested with version macOS 10.10.3
- **Windows**: Untested

#### Description

Converts macOS or iCloud Contacts vCard exports to 1PIF for 1Password import. The contact data can be placed into 1Password's Identity or Secure Notes category. The default is the Identity category.

#### Instructions

**macOS Contacts**: To export from macOS Contacts, launch the macOS **Contacts** app, select the desired contacts, and export them to a vCard file using the `File > Export... > Export vCard...` menu. Navigate to your **Desktop** folder, and in the `Save As` area, enter the file name **pm_export**. Click `Save` The exported vCard file will be on your Desktop with the name **pm_export.vcf**. You may now quit Contacts.

**iCloud Contacts**: To export from Contacts on iCloud, launch **Safari**, and log into your iCloud account. Click the `Contacts` icon. Select one or more contacts from the list (you can click on a single contact and then use ⌘ + A to select all contacts). Click the gear icon at the bottom left of the browser window, and select `Export vCard...`. Safari will create a new **.vcf** file in your Downloads folder. It will also prompt you to import your items into Contacts - you probably want to deny this by hitting the `Cancel` button. You may now log out of your browser's iCloud session, or just quit Safari, or close the page. Move the newly created .vcf file onto your Desktop, and convert this file.

#### Notes

To place items into Secure Notes, use the `--securenote` option.

The `--icon` option will cause the converter to import the vCard's icon, provided that either of the GD or ImageMagick Perl libraries is installed.

Although this is a generic vCard converter, the format is complex, and this converter has only been tested with the macOS or iCloud Contacts. Additional support can be requested - see [this forum post](https://discussions.agilebits.com/discussion/101691/moving-to-1password-from-another-password-manager-mac/p1).

Next, go to step [**2\. Convert**](#step2).

---

## 2\. Convert

**FYI**: The converter does not modify your password manager's data, nor transmit your data across the network.

It is time to convert - click on the name of your OS:

- [macOS](#step2macos)

- [Windows](#step2windows)

### macOS

You have two options:

1.  Use the **macOSConvertHelper** to simplify building the command line.

2.  Manually type the command line in Terminal.

#### Option 1: Using the macOSConvertHelper

Double-click the **macOSConvertHelper** app, or drag your exported data file _onto_ the app. Follow the on-screen instructions.

You may get some error / warning dialogs - this is macOS' Gatekeeper being cautious, in case you were not expecting this activity. Here's what to do:

- If you get the macOS error dialog with the message _"App can’t be opened because it is from an unidentified developer"_, click `OK`, and instead, right-click the macOSConvertHelper app and select `Open`.

- On macOS Mojave and later, if you get a dialog with the message _"macOSConvertHelper" wants access to control "Terminal"..._ - click `OK` to allow macOSConvertHelper to issue its converter command in the Terminal app.

- On macOS Catalina, you may receive additional dialogs asking for certain permissions. You will need to grant these to allow the script to run.

After you've selected your converter, and entered any options, a Terminal window will open to run the conversion, show you the status of the conversion, and the location of the generated 1PIF file. You may `Quit` the Terminal application after the conversion.

#### Option 2: Manually entering the command line

You prefer to enter the converter command manually, so open the **Terminal** app (or your preferred terminal emulator). First change the current direction by issuing the following command in **Terminal**:

<div style="background-color: #eeeeee; width: 95%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px">

<pre style="color: #000000; padding-top: 0px; margin: 1px 8px 1px 8px;">cd ~/Desktop/mrc-converter-suite
</pre>

</div>

and hit Return.

Now, the conversion command command takes the form:

<div style="background-color: #eeeeee; width: 95%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px">

<pre style="color: #000000; padding-top: 0px; margin: 1px 8px 1px 8px;">perl convert.pl _<options>_ _<converter_name>_ _<export_file>_
</pre>

</div>

where _<converter_name>_ is the name of the specific converter you want to use, and _<export_file>_ is the path to your export file. For _<options>_, you generally always want to use at least `-v` for verbose output (see also [Options](#options)). For example, if you exported data from Enpass, and your export file is on your Desktop named **pm_export.json**, the command to enter is:

<div style="background-color: #eeeeee; width: 95%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px">

<pre style="color: #000000; padding-top: 0px; margin: 1px 8px 1px 8px;">perl convert.pl -v enpass ~/Desktop/pm_export.json
</pre>

</div>

Hit Return after you've typed the command, and the conversion will proceed. If you need to see the more information about how to use **convert.pl**, and the options it supports, issue the command:

<div style="background-color: #eeeeee; width: 95%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px">

<pre style="color: #000000; padding-top: 0px; margin: 1px 8px 1px 8px;">perl convert.pl --help
</pre>

</div>

See also the [Option --help](#optionhelp) section.

If you are done converting, you are ready for step [3\. Import into 1Password](#step3).

### Windows

You are almost ready to convert your data. Windows users have a little more work to do first. Sorry about that. You'll need to (temporarily) install the free, widely-used [Strawberry Perl](http://strawberryperl.com/). Download the **Recommended version**, and, install it. It will take a few minutes.

After Strawberry Perl is installed, click the Windows Start menu, and click in the Search area (Windows 10: `Type here to search`; Windows 7 `Search programs and files`). Type `cmd` in the Search area, and then press Return, to Launch a Windows command shell. The steps below are to be typed in the command shell window. Press the Return key after you enter a command to execute it.

It was suggested that you place the mrc-converter-suite folder on your Desktop (make sure it is there, or you'll need to adjust the commands below). You need to tell the command shell to go there now.

If your user profile is _not_ on the C: drive, type your drive _letter_ followed by a **:** (colon). For example, if your drive is **E:**, type `E:` and hit Return.

Copy and paste the command below, or enter it manually:

<div style="background-color: #eeeeee; width: 95%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px">

<pre style="color: #000000; padding-top: 0px; margin: 1px 8px 1px 8px;">cd %USERPROFILE%\Desktop\mrc-converter-suite
</pre>

</div>

The converter needs a few extra Perl modules. Copy and paste the command below, or enter it manually:

<div style="background-color: #eeeeee; width: 95%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px">

<pre style="color: #000000; padding-top: 0px; margin: 1px 8px 1px 8px;">install_modules.bat
</pre>

</div>

This will take a few minutes to download, compile, and install the modules. You need admin privileges to do this.

Now, you are _finally_ ready to convert!

The convert command in the command shell takes the form:

<div style="background-color: #eeeeee; width: 95%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px">

<pre style="color: #000000; padding-top: 0px; margin: 1px 8px 1px 8px;">perl convert.pl _<options>_ _<converter_name>_ _<export_file>_
</pre>

</div>

where _<converter_name>_ is the name of the specific converter you want to use, and _<export_file>_ is the path to your export file. For _<options>_, you generally always want to use at least `-v` for verbose output (see also [Options](#options)). For example, if you exported data from Enpass, and your export file is on your Desktop named **pm_export.json**, the command to enter is:

<div style="background-color: #eeeeee; width: 95%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px">

<pre style="color: #000000; padding-top: 0px; margin: 1px 8px 1px 8px;">perl convert.pl -v enpass ..\pm_export.json
</pre>

</div>

The conversion will proceed. If you need to see the more information about how to use **convert.pl**, and the options it supports, issue the command:

<div style="background-color: #eeeeee; width: 95%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px">

<pre style="color: #000000; padding-top: 0px; margin: 1px 8px 1px 8px;">perl convert.pl --help
</pre>

</div>

See also the [Option --help](#optionhelp) section.

If you are done converting, you are ready for step [3\. Import into 1Password](#step3).

## 3\. Import into 1Password

After a successful conversion, there will be a file on your Desktop named **1P_import.1pif** (the **onepif** converter differs, see Note below). The 1P_import.1pif file can now be imported into a desktop version of 1Password. Open your 1Password desktop app. The import procedure varies slightly in each 1Password version:

- **macOS**: The easiest way to import the 1P_import.1pif file is to first select the vault where you will import (if you have multiple vaults), and then drag the 1P_import.1pif onto the 1Password icon on the macOS dock. Alternatively, you can use the `File > Import` menu. In 1Password 7, when the `Import` dialog appears, select `Other` and then select `Import a 1PIF file`.

- **Windows**: In 1Password 7, select the `1Password > Import` menu item and follow the on-screen instructions to import the 1P_import.1pif file.

After importing, you should now have new items in 1Password. These items may require some clean-up, for various reasons. It is time to finish this conversion process with step [4\. Cleanup](#step4).

**Note**: If you used the **onepif** converter, the files created are named **1P_converted.html** or **1P_converted.csv** (depending on which export formatter you used).

## 4\. Cleanup

It is a very good idea to remove your _unencrypted_ export and the resulting 1PIF data files as soon as possible.

But before you do this, take a quick look through the results of the import. If you are satisfied, securely remove any unencrypted files now (the converter-created files / directories have names such as 1P_import.1pif, 1P_converted.html, 1P_converted.csv, and 1P_Attachments.

If you are not satisfied, review the sections below, to gain a better understand about what happens during the conversion.

When you are done with your conversion(s), you may delete the mrc-converter-suite, and Windows users may uninstall Strawberry Perl.

### Data Mapping

Some of your previous password manager's categories and fields may not directly translate into those available in 1Password. And some values cannot map unambiguously, or be safely converted, into 1Password fields. There are some basic rules for how the converter handles these situations. For any given item:

1.  If there is no natural or reasonable 1Password category match, it will become a Secure Note.

2.  If the converter cannot determine the category, it will become a Secure Note.

3.  If a field has better utility in 1Password when placed into a different category, then the item will be split and the field will go into the category better suited for its purpose. See [Record Splitting](#recordsplitting) below.

4.  If a field cannot be placed into one of the resulting target categories, it will be placed into either a custom section/field, or will be added to the item's Notes area as a Field: Value pair.

### Record Splitting

1Password has a particular working paradigm, so the converter tries to place an item into the category with the most utility. To do this, a single item from your password manager may be _split_ into multiple 1Password items, each a different category. For example, a single form fill profile item from a particular password manager can result in four separate 1Password items, one item created for the primary matched category such as _Identity_, and three secondary items such as _Credit Card_, _Bank Account_, and _Social Security Number_.

When a field matches a known field, but it cannot be placed into a 1Password field, for any reason, it will be placed into the primary items's Notes area.

When a field is unknown, it will be placed into the Notes areas for _both_ the primary and secondary items. This allows you to easily examine and edit the items resulting from the split to decide where you want the Field: Value pair.

### Date Fields

Some password managers provide no input validation for date fields, and their date values are non-validated simple text. They allow, for example, entry of nonsense dates such as _Feb 31, 2015_, _Tomorrow_ or _Take out the garbage_. 1Password dates are strict, so date validation is performed by the converter where sensible. When a date field can be arbitrary text, or is not validated by the password manager, the converter will not interpret the field, and it will be placed into the Notes section.

Some 1Password date fields are only stored as month / year values. If conversion of a date would result in a loss of information (e.g. when the date value also contains a day component), the converter will both store the 1Password-appropriate date, and also store the original value in an item's Notes section.

When an invalid date is detected, it is stored in the Notes section.

Some password managers export no century component to their date's year values. The converter employs a strategy, depending upon the particular date field, to default to a sensible century value. For example, a _Valid From_ date of 12/03 is almost certainly 12/2003 rather than 12/1903, and if today were Oct 9th, 2014, a birthdate of 11/14 cannot be 11/2014.

### Groups, Tags, and Other Indicators

Some password management programs allow placement of items into groups or folders (flat or hierarchical). When available in the export, these will be recreated as `/` (forward slash) separated lists of 1Password Tags. With the `--folders` option, and for versions of 1Password that support Folders, items will also be placed into the appropriately named 1Password Folder.

**Note**: Older versions of the 1Password for Windows do not show Tag values in the main UI. The Tags do exist in the items, however, and can be seen in the Tags section when editing an item.

Likewise, any tags, favorite or star markers, when available for an item, will become 1Password Tags.

Finally, other esoteric password manager-specific markers (e.g. an item's color set to _Blue_), if exported, will be placed into the 1Password item's Notes section (e.g. Color: Blue).

### Attachments

Some password managers support importing documents or attachments, but may not support exporting them. When attachments are exported, some converters will export these attachments, placing them into a **1P_Attachments** folder at the same location as the generated 1P*import.1pif file. The **mrc-converter-suite** does \_not* support importing attachments into 1Password (due to some technical and usability issues).

### Why Things Go Wrong

Many password management programs export their data in a limited or ambiguous format. Problems can arise when:

- field labels are not present.
- field labels are generic or non-specific.
- fields are unclear or undefined.
- field values are invalid for the data type (e.g. non-validated garbage dates, etc.).
- fields with empty values are omitted from the export.
- non-unique field labels are used in several categories (can thwart category detection).
- the export format varies across platforms and/or versions.
- the export format is non-standard, broken, or ambiguous.
- record boundaries are poorly defined or ambiguous.
- field, category, or template customization is semantically meaningful only to the user.
- parts of record data is omitted, botched, or abridged.
- field labels, etc. are exported in mixed languages.
- two or more distinct field labels are translated into a single label in different language.
- data is repeatedly imported/exported from one password manager to another, and categories become meaningless or unidentifiable.

When no category information is present, converters attempt to determine the type of item based on matching certain key field labels against a table of stock, known entries. When no field labels exist, the specific number of fields may be used. Some converters may use other information present in the export file to hint at the item type.

Some password managers support customized templates, or customizing the fields of an item. Customized field names which are not recognized by the converter will be included in the item's Notes section as Field: Value pairs. When no field labels exist, generic field labels will be used, such as **Field\_**_#_ (where _#_ is 1, 2, ...). Customized items which cannot be matched against a known category will assigned to a 1Password Secure Note.

### When Things Go Wrong

Each converter employs a table of input categories, and for each category a set of field definitions and special instructions or processing code. Field names, field positions, or certain indicators are used to match an item to a category. The field names in the converters are either simple strings, but more often regular expression patterns. These may be customized to accommodate your specific needs. New custom input categories may be added to the table, and this may be useful if you have many entries of that category. Since 1Password items cannot be moved from one category to another, it is worthwhile to get the conversion as close to your needs as possible. It is often possible to map custom fields to 1Password user-defined fields within an existing section, or a user-defined section. Please ask for more details on how this might be accomplished.

## Command Line Options

This section describes the standard command line options supported by the converter. Options may be placed anywhere on the command line.

### Option: `--addfields`

By default, password manager fields that do not naturally map into 1Password fields are placed into an item's Notes section as Field: Value pairs. The `--addfields` option will instead generate custom fields, and place them in a section named **Original Fields**.

### Option: `--checkpass`

The `--checkpass` option will safely test the passwords found in your export against a list of over 500 million passwords known to be compromised. It uses the Troy Hunt [Pwned Passwords facility](https://www.troyhunt.com/ive-just-launched-pwned-passwords-version-2/). Passwords are **not** transmitted over the network. This facility is [endorsed and used](https://blog.agilebits.com/2018/02/22/finding-pwned-passwords-with-1password/) by AgileBits.

If any password field in an item is found to be compromised, the item is tagged with **Password Compromised**. You can easily find these by looking for items with this Tag in 1Password after you have imported your 1PIF. Information about these items will also be output when using the `--verbose` option, including a summary of the total number of discovered compromised passwords.

The code used to perform these checks is _not_ loaded unless you specify the `--checkpass` option.

For specific implementation details, see **Searching by range** under the [Pwned Passwords overview](https://haveibeenpwned.com/API/v2#PwnedPasswords). In a nutshell, a password is hashed using the SHA1 algorithm, and the first 5 hexadecimal values of that hash - the prefix - is provided to the API. A list is returned of all the SHA1 prefix values that match, and the converter checks your password's SHA1 to see if it is contained in that list. If it is found, the item is tagged. Your passwords are _never_ transmitted.

**Note**: This feature is more aggressive than 1Password 7's Watchtower test to check compromised passwords. Watchtower does not check _all_ of the passwords in an item; it checks only _one_ specific password.

**Note**: To use Watchtower's check for compromised passwords, enable 1Password's `Preferences > Watchtower > Check for Compromised Logins`, and check the Watchtower area in the sidebar. See also the [1Password's Watchtower](https://support.1password.com/watchtower/) article.

### Option: `--debug`

Enables highly verbose output useful for diagnosing issues with conversion.

**Caution**: The output will contain sensitive information.

### Option: `--imptypes` and `--exptypes`

All of your exported items will be processed and converted to 1Password categories. The options `--imptypes` and `--exptypes` allow you to selectively choose which of your password manager's exported categories to process on import, and which categories to export to the 1PIF file, respectively.

For example, if you only wanted eWallet's types `bankacct` and `votercard` converted, add the option `--imptypes bankacct,votercard` to the command line. And if you only wanted 1Password Secure Notes to be exported into the 1PIF file, then add the option `--exptypes note`.

These options may result in more entries than you expect due to [Record Splitting](#recordsplitting). Take care when using `--exptypes` with categories that split.

### Option: `--folders`

The `--folders` option supports the creation of Folders in 1Password, and places your records into the same folder hierarchy as supported in your password manager. This feature is disabled by default, because the converter is unaware of existing folders in your vault. If you use this option, existing Folder names in the vault are ignored, and the converter will create new Folders, possibly with names identical to those already in your vault. In addition, re-running the converter and re-importing will duplicate the Folder names, since new unique folder identifiers are created each time the converter is run. For best results, import converted data only into a fresh vault.

**Note**: Folders are no longer supported in 1Password 7 - Tags are used instead.

### Option: `--help`

For usage help, use the `--help` option:

<div style="background-color: #eeeeee; width: 95%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px">

### Option: `--notimestamps`

The converter will use your password manager's time stamps, if they exist, for record creation and record modification. The `--notimestamps` option disables this, allowing 1Password to set the time stamps as it creates the records (i.e. they will be set to the time you import the 1PIF file).

**Note**: The modified date used by various password managers may reflect the date the record was last updated, or the date the password field was last updated. The converter can only set the `last modified` value for the entire 1Password item, and not for any specific field within the item.

**Note**: Setting time stamps requires at least 1Password for Mac 5.3.BETA-17.

### Option: `--tags`

The `--tags` option will assign one or more 1Password Tags to the converted items. Supply one or more comma-separated tag values. Example `--tags Foo,Bar` or `--tags "Joe Kerr,Sam Pull"`.

### Option: `--verbose`

The converter runs silently by default, unless it encounters problems. Verbose output provides some basic information about the number of imported and exported records, tallied per export category key, and the location of the generated 1PIF file. Some converters may produce a few additional details (such as the location of any attachments exported), or may request confirmation, or password credentials (if they decrypt the password database directly).

Example:

<div style="background-color: #eeeeee; width: 95%; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  padding-top: 2px; padding-bottom: 2px">

## Closing Comments

The converter suite was written using Perl, a readable scripting language. This was done not only because it is a good cross-platform language, but more importantly, so that you can examine and audit the source code. This hopefully provides you with confidence that your private data is not transmitted, or used in any unintended way. You are free and welcome to examine the code, and to ask any questions.

Hopefully neither this guide, nor the process, has been too intimidating. I fully appreciate how novel this conversion process must be for 95% of you! The guide tries to be hand-holding, yet comprehensive, the process as simple as possible but safe. When dealing with an audience of widely varying skill sets and knowledge levels, the challenges are not insignificant.
